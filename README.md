# COA-TASKFORCE---TAKE-HOME-CHALLENGE
This repository contains a folder which contain files and subfolders which contain files which contain program codes which contain lots of brilliance about the 02 June 2024 COA TASKFORCE - TAKE HOME CHALLENGE.
This folder consists of a folder with two sufolders,a file and this README file.
-Each subfolder has a ".htm",For experimentation on how the code works and layout demonstration if opened in a local browser.
-Starting by the first subfolder "Responsive Gallery" that contains files that structure a responsive gallery.Here's a quick explanation on its 1 subfolder and 4 files:

1)First up it's the "responsiveGallery.htm" file with HTML codes to experimentate how the code works as stated above and for layout demonstration.
2)There's the "responsiveGallery.css" file that contains the CSS codes used to style the gallery.
3)The third file is the "responsiveGallery.js" that contains JavaScript Codes to define user interaction with the gallery.
4)"DINCondensed-Light.woff" is the font file used for some of the text to be displayed.
5)And finally we have the "Images" subfolder that contains the gallery images.
Open the "responsiveGallery.htm" to explore te functionality of the responsive gallery

-Our second subfolder is "stringTransform".This subfolder contains files with codes to transform text entered by user depending on the number of characters the entered text has.
The conditions for those transformations are:

1)The the entered text must have between 1 and 1000 characters.
2)If the entered text's number of characters is divisible by 3,the entered text will be reversed;
3)If the entered text's number of characters is divisible by 5,the entered text will converted to ASCII code.
4)If the entered text's number of characters is divisible by both 5 and 3,the entered text will be reversed and then converted to ASCII code.
5)If the entered text's number of characters is neither divisible by 5 nor by 3,the string won't be converted.

-stringTransform has "stringTransform.htm" to put the "stringTransform.js" codes in action.

-Then the last and the least trust me "arrayMap" file that was supposed to check if in an array there exists a subarray such that the elements of that subarray add up to a given target number.Unfortunately,turns out that even I have limits.But well yeah...the best one can do is try and that's what I did.
Run the file in your favored interpreter to check how far I got or how far was I.

 And so yeah that wraps the COA-TASKFORCE---TAKE-HOME-CHALLENGE up.And yes of course in it,you'll find in this READ ME FILE too.
 In addition,there're a few comments in files with program codes that'd provide more information if you open them in a code editor.
